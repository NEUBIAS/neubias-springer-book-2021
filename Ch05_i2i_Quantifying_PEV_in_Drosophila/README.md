# i.2.i. with the (fruit) fly: Quantifying position effect variegation in *Drosophila melanogaster*

This folder contains the code discussed in Chapter 5 about the i2i workflow for quantifying position effecti variegation in *Drosophila melanogaster* eyes.

This semi-automated workflow uses [ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) for segmentation of 'eye spots' and [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) scripts to do the post-processing and quantification.

Happy quantifying!
